# Project Overview

## Project Name 
[Rep Powerlifting](https://rodennis.github.io/rep-powerlifting/)

## Project Description

This project is a social website/app for powerlifters. It will be a place where powerlifters can post videos or photos of their lifts, on a single timeline for everyone to see. People will be able to like and comment on the photos. I wanted to make a website/app that was specific for powerlifters because I dont believe there is one.
